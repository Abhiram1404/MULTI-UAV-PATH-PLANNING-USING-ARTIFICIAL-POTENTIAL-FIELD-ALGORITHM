# MULTI-UAV-PATH-PLANNING-USING-ARTIFICIAL-POTENTIAL-FIELD-ALGORITHM


With regard to real-time planning, this effort adds to the expanding body of research on multi-agent autonomous systems. If an autonomous agent can finish a task on its own, then several autonomous agents might be able to finish it more quickly.The purpose of this is to use and improve the APF algorithm in order to make multi-agent autonomous systems common for real-world applications.
The obstacle avoidance mechanism of a drone has a big impact on how well it navigates. The conventional method ignores the positional dynamics between  obstacles and drones during flight, but the artificial potential field (APF) method provides a quick obstacle reaction. Due to problems including local minima, unattainable targets, and less-than-ideal obstacle avoidance techniques, this weakness causes flights to take longer and use more energy. An improved APF approach is suggested in order to overcome these difficulties. A collision risk assessment method is incorporated as part of the enhancement to limit the length of the UAV flight path and prevent unreasonable obstacle avoidance actions. Additionally, by creating virtual sub-goals and altering the conventional APF model, a solution to the issues of  unreachable targets and local minima is shown. With this update, the drone can effectively navigate around obstacles and arrive at the desired location. In order to identify a logical virtual sub-target and produce a more sensible obstacle-avoiding path than the traditional APF technique, the algorithm also includes a virtual sub-target assessment factor. The suggested method makes it easier to prepare a reasonable course of action, which makes it useful in contexts that are dynamic and complex.
